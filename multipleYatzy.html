            <h4>Multiple Yahtzees</h4>
            <li>You already have a Yahtzee: You get a 100 bonus points in the Yahtzee box, <br>
                but you also have a joker, which means that you can choose another move for<br>
                the Yahtzee you just got. If the number you got yahtzees with has not been<br>
                filled out in the upper section, then you must choose that. E.g. if you get an<br>
                additional Yahtzee with 2's, and you haven't filled out the 2's in the upper<br>
                section then you must choose that, and get 10 points for it. If the upper section<br>
                box is already filled then you can choose any of the lower region boxes, and<br>
                they will be scored as normal. Yahtzee is a superset of 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind,<br>
                full house and chance, but you can also choose small or large straight and will<br>
                get the normal 30 and 40 points for those.</li>
            <li>You've already put 0 in the Yahtzee box: In this case you get no 100 point<br>
                bonus, but you do get a joker, and can choose your move following the rules<br>
                described above for jokers.</li>
