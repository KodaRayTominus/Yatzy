                <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                <li>In each turn a player may throw the dice up to three times. A player doesn't have to roll </li>
                <li> all five dice on the second and third throw of a round, you may put as many dice as you <br>
                    want to the side and only throw the ones that don't have the numbers your trying to <br>
                    get. For example, if you throw and gets 1,3,3,4,6. and decides you want to try for the <br>
                    large straight, 1,2,3,4,5. So, you puts 1,3,4 to the side and only throw 3 and 6 again, <br>
                    hoping to get 2 and 5. </li>
                <li>In this game you click on the dice you want to keep. They will be moved down and will <br>
                    not be thrown the next time you press the 'Roll Dice' button. If you decide after the <br>
                    second throw in a turn that you don't want to keep the same dice before the third throw <br>
                    then you can click them again and they will move back to the table and be thrown in the <br>
                    third throw.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="upperSectionRules">
                <h4>Upper section combinations</h4>
                <li>Ones: Get as many ones as possible.</li>
                <li>Twos: Get as many twos as possible.</li>
                <li>Threes: Get as many threes as possible.</li>
                <li>Fours: Get as many fours as possible.</li>
                <li>Fives: Get as many fives as possible.</li>
                <li>Sixes: Get as many sixes as possible.</li>
                <li>For the six combinations above the score for each of them is the sum of dice of the <br>
                    right kind. E.g. if you get 1,3,3,3,5 and you choose Threes you will get 3*3 = 9 points. <br>
                    The sum of all the above combinations is calculated and if it is 63 or more, the player <br>
                    will get a bonus of 35 points. On average a player needs three of each to reach 63, but <br>
                    it is not required to get three of each exactly, it is perfectly OK to have five sixes, and <br>
                    zero ones for example, as long as the sum is 63 or more the bonus will be awarded.</li>

                <li>Chance: You can put anything into chance,  The score is simply the sum of the dice.</li>
